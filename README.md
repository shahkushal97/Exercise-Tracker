# Exercise-Tracker
Built a portal for users to track their exercises related information such as duration, type of exercise etc. Used Node.js and React to implement the user interface and the Create, Update, Delete and Retrieve operations.   
Used MongoDB to store the user information and used mongoose to design the schema.
Reffered the implementation from https://medium.com/@beaucarnes/learn-the-mern-stack-by-building-an-exercise-tracker-mern-tutorial-59c13c1237a1
